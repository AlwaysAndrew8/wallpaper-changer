# wallpaper-changer
swww and hyprland. This is a fix for an error I would get that resulted in my wallpapers not being properly changed due to swww. The fix is clearing the cache every time a wallpaper changes, I automated that and added wallpapers. It also includes pywalfox updates as well for those who use firefox.
